# Singleton design pattern
> We have seen a very simple example of the Singleton pattern, partially applied to some situation, that is, a simple counter.
Just keep in mind that the Singleton pattern will give you the power to have a unique instance of some struct
 in your application and that no package can create any clone of this struct.

# Builder design pattern
> reusing an algorithm to create many implementations of an interface

Talking about Creational design patterns, it looks pretty semantic to have a Builder design pattern.
The Builder pattern helps us construct complex objects without directly instantiating their struct, or writing the logic they require.

# Factory method
> delegating the creation of different types of payments

## objectives

- Delegating the creation of new instances of structures to a different part of the program
- Working at the interface level instead of with concrete implementations
- Grouping families of objects to obtain a family object creator

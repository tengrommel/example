# Singleton design pattern
> We have seen a very simple example of the Singleton pattern, partially applied to some situation, that is, a simple counter.
Just keep in mind that the Singleton pattern will give you the power to have a unique instance of some struct
 in your application and that no package can create any clone of this struct.

Talking about Creational design patterns, it looks pretty semantic to have a Builder design pattern.
The Builder pattern helps us construct complex objects without directly instantiating their struct, or writing the logic they require.

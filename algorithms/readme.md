# Linear Data Structure

Various applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, use lists and linear data structures.
As We have discussed previously, data structures allow us to organize vast swathes of data in a sequential and organized manner, 
thereby reducing time and effect in working with such a data. Lists, stacks, sets, and tuples are some of the commonly used
linear data structures.

Let's discuss the operations related to add, update, remove, and lookup on linked list and doubly linked list in the following section.

## Lists
> A list is a collection of ordered elements that are used to store list of items. Unlike array lists, these can expand and shrink dynamically.

Lists also be used as a base for other data structures, such as stack and queue.

Lists can be used to store lists of users, car parts, ingredients, to-do items, and various other such elements.

Lists are the most commonly used linear data structures.

## LinkedList
> LinkedList is a sequence of nodes that have properties and a reference to the next new node in the sequence.
